# Java-TicTacToe-Game
A JFrame TicTacToe Game group project that I led. This is a concerted team effort and all credits go out to all the members of this wonderful group.

This is a TicTacToe program that allows two players to compete.
Features include continuous gameplay and a pointing system. The design was inspired by Squid Game, following the pink, green, white, and gray color scheme.
Feel free to modify the code or fix any bugs, if there are any.
